---- Table structure for table `sentence_annotations`---- This table currently stores the indices for Japanese sentences and is used only-- by Jim Breen and his peers. It may have to be renamed into 'sentence_indices'-- if someday we implement a feature for anyone to annotate sentences other than-- through the comments.---- id          Id of the annotation.-- sentence_id Id of the sentence annotated.-- meaning_id  Id of the sentence used to disambiguate the meaning of the annotated--               sentence.-- dico_id     Id of the annotated sentence in the old version of Tatoeba. This is--                not in use anymore, and can potentially be deleted.-- text        Text of the annotation.--CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `sentence_annotations` (  `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,  `sentence_id` int(11) NOT NULL,  `meaning_id` int(11) NOT NULL,  `dico_id` int(11) NOT NULL,  `text` varbinary(2000) NOT NULL,  PRIMARY KEY  (`id`),  KEY `dico_id` (`dico_id`),  KEY `sentence_id` (`sentence_id`)) ENGINE=MyISAM  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 AUTO_INCREMENT=150418 ;
