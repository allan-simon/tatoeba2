                    a sentence, you can only contact the admin.

                </li>
                <li>
                    However, it is possible to edit a translation that you have 
                    just added (useful if you've noticed a mistake right after 
                    saving your translation).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <li>Adopt sentences</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    There are many sentences in Tatoeba that do not have an owner. 
                    These sentencse can be adopted.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you notice a mistake in a sentence that is not owned by 
                    anyone, you can adopt the sentence, and afterwards modify it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can also adopt sentences that are correct. 
                    Adopting is also a way to mark a sentence as correct.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <li>Post comments</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You can post comments about a specific sentence. This is useful 
                    when for instance you don't understand it and would like more 
                    explanations. But of course you can always add explanations 
                    for sentences that you understand, in order to help people who 
                    learn the language. You can also post a comment if you saw 
                    a mistake but are not the owner of the sentence, or if 
                    you are not sure about how to correct it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The owner of the sentence will receive a notification 
                    by email every time someone posts a comment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All the people who have participated to 
                    the thread will also receive a notification.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <li>View logs &amp; statistics</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Everytime a sentence is added, modified, or deleted, 
                    the action is logged.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The 10 last logs entries can be seen on the homepage. 
                    The 200 last logs entries can be seen after clicking on 
                    "Show more...".
                </li>
                <li>
                    Based on these logs, we're showing the activity in Tatoeba 
                    in the "activity timeline" : it indicates for each day the sum 
                    of number of sentences added and the number of modificaitons.
