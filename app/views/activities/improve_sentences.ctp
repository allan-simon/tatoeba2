    <p>The community came up with a few "utility tags" to improve the quality and
    the reliability of the sentences.
    <ul>
        <li><?php echo $changeLink; ?> - The sentence needs to be changed.</li>
        <li><?php echo $checkLink; ?> - The sentence needs to be checked.</li>
        <li><?php echo $nncLink; ?> - The sentence needs to be checked by a native 
        speakers.</li>
        <li><?php echo $okLink; ?> - The sentence is considered correct by at least
        one person.</li>

    <h2>How to help</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>You need to be a <a href="/faq#trusted-user">trusted user</a> 
        otherwise you won't be able to tag sentences.</li>
        <li>Whenever you notice a sentence that is wrong or sounds really strange, 
        add the tag <?php echo $changeLink; ?> and post a comment to suggest a 
        correction or better phrasing.</li>
        <li>Whenever you notice a possible mistake, add the tag 
        <?php echo $checkLink; ?> and post a comment explaining what you think the 
        mistake may be.</li>
        <li>Whenever you add sentences in a foreign language and aren't completely
        sure they are correct, add the tag <?php echo $nncLink; ?>.</li>
        <li>Whenever you can, browse through sentences that are tagged 
        <?php echo $changeLink; ?>,  <?php echo $checkLink; ?>, 
        <?php echo $nncLink; ?> to discuss the sentences with other
        members and help decide what to do with these sentences.</li>
        <li>Once the case of a problematic sentence has been solved, tag it
        <?php echo $okLink; ?>. More generally, you can browse and check other's 
        sentences, and tag them with <?php echo $okLink; ?> to indicate you consider 
        they are correct. But do this when you are 100% sure that the sentence
        is correct, and don't use the tag on your own sentences because it's not
        very useful.</li>
